# gallery3 cookbook

This cookbook is used to configure a Vagrant box with all prerequisites for hacking
on Gallery3. It contains two shell scripts, `box-build.sh` and `box-upload.sh` which build
the box from scratch and upload it to a server where it is hosted.

The purpose of this cookbook is not to manage a Gallery3 installation, although it does
contain a recipe for performing the installation.
